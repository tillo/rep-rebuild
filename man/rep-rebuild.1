.SH "NAME"
rep\-rebuild \- Gentoo: SVN/CVS packages rebuilder
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B rep\-rebuild
[OPTIONS] [\-\-] [EMERGE OPTIONS]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Perl script to rebuild Gentoo's Portage SVN/CVS installed packages, taking care of dependencies and emerge ordering.

Gentoo Portage doesn't care about an SVN/CVS package's repository being updated, and everyone needs to check manually when a package's repository has been updated, check the dependencies and rebuild manually all the packages in the right order.

This program will avoid the second task. In a future release it will probably check if a new SVN/CVS revision is there before emerging.

It is inspired to revdep-rebuild from Gentoo's portage utilities.
