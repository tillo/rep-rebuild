NAME
       rep-rebuild - Gentoo: SVN/CVS packages rebuilder

SYNOPSIS
       rep-rebuild [OPTIONS] [--] [EMERGE OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Perl  script  to  rebuild  Gentoo's Portage SVN/CVS installed packages,
       taking care of dependencies and emerge ordering.

       Gentoo Portage doesn't care about an SVN/CVS package's repository being
       updated,  and everyone needs to check manually when a package's reposi-
       tory has been updated, check the dependencies and rebuild manually  all
       the packages in the right order.

       This  program  will  avoid the second task. In a future release it will
       probably check if a new SVN/CVS revision is there before emerging.

       It is inspired to revdep-rebuild from Gentoo's portage utilities.

OPTIONS
       -nc | --nocolor
              turn off colored output (this  option  is  also  passed  to  the
              emerge command)

       -d | --debug
              print  debug  messages  about  packages, their dependencies, and
              follow the dependencies algotithm (all in realtime)

       -h | --help
              print help message and quit

       -V | --version
              print version and quit

              All  other  options are passed to the emerge command. By the way
              "--oneshot" is passed to it whatever happens.

EXAMPLES
       It  is  recommended  to  use  the  following   command   when   running
       rep-rebuild:

       rep-rebuild --ask

EXIT STATUS
       rep-rebuild  returns  a  zero  exit status if it succeeds.  Non zero is
       returned in case of failure.
